## 🏰 The Funebrad Castle

Perfect, partner 🙌 — let’s draft it so it carries both **authorship** and a **clear distinction** between **Funebra** and the well-known math tools. Here’s a widely understandable explanation you can share (on your site, LinkedIn, GitHub, or even bundled inside the `.obj` file description):

This castle isn’t just a model — it’s a **Funebrad object**: a geometry generated entirely through the **Funebra Math-Art Engine**. Every tower, wall, crenellation, and gate comes from algebraic expressions, procedural rules, and point-cloud logic — the language of Funebra.

### 🔹 Why Funebra and not GeoGebra, WolframAlpha, or others?

* **GeoGebra** is made for teaching math interactively. It’s excellent for classrooms, but it focuses on *visual proofs* and *graphing exercises*. It doesn’t aim at hackable art or printable objects.
* **WolframAlpha** is a computational powerhouse. It answers symbolic questions, plots graphs, solves equations — but it’s closed, black-box, and not meant for playful *hack-and-paint* art creation.
* **Processing/p5.js** are coding frameworks for creative coding. They’re powerful, but they’re general-purpose; the math inside them isn’t branded as a universal language the way Funebra is.

👉 **Funebra is different**:

* It treats algebra as **a playground** where math = art = object.
* It works in the browser, hackable in real time: change a formula, see the geometry emerge.
* Every point follows a **Funebra law of motion** (polygonX, starY, crossZ…), so even castles are built from pure parametric DNA.
* It bridges directly to **3D printing**: what you imagine mathematically, you can hold in your hand.

### 🔹 What makes this castle Funebrad?

* The **walls** are boxes defined by algebraic boundaries.
* The **towers** are cylinders parameterized by radius, height, and segments (trigonometry in action).
* The **crenellations** are repeating modular boxes placed with step-functions (discrete algebra).
* The **keep** is a scaled square function in 3D space.
* Even the **gate** is algebraic: it’s not “drawn” but carved out by subtracting intervals in the coordinate system.

This makes the castle not a mere model, but a **manifestation of Funebra math**: parametric expressions transformed into medieval architecture.

### 🔹 Why it matters

By declaring it **Funebrad**, we emphasize that:

* It’s born from **math-art expressions**, not pre-built CAD blocks.
* It belongs to the **Funebra ecosystem**, where algebra drives creation.
* It shows how Funebra can go beyond curves and roses into **architecture, history, and imagination**.
