# Funebra Repo Booster Kit (Root Sitemap Fix)

This folder adds missing SEO, UI, and branding essentials.

## What's Inside
- **meta-head.html** → Insert into `<head>` of your site for SEO/social cards.
- **robots.txt** → Crawling rules + sitemap reference.
- **sitemap.xml** → Root sitemap (required by Google Search Console).
- **assets/og/funebra-og.png** → OG image banner (1200×630px).
- **assets/ui/footer.html** → "Powered by Funebra™" snippet.

## Next Steps
1. Place `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` at the repo root (next to `index.html`).
2. Replace/update `funebra-og.png` with new visuals as needed.
3. Include `meta-head.html` in your GitHub Pages template.
