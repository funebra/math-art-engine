# Math-Art Engine 1.0 🎨🧮

An experimental browser-based 3D/2D math-art playground.  
No libraries, no canvas — just pure **HTML + JavaScript + DOM**.

## 🚀 Demo
👉 [Live on GitHub Pages](https://funebra.github.io/math-art-engine/)

## ✨ Features
- Draw points and lines in 3D with fake perspective
- Build simple objects (cubes, houses, polygons, circles)
- 100% hackable — edit the code and see instant changes
- Lightweight: runs directly in the browser

## 📂 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Hack the JavaScript to create your own math-art forms!

## 🛠 Roadmap
- Add sliders for angle, radius, speed
- Include demo objects (cube, spiral, rose curves)
- Community contributions welcome!
